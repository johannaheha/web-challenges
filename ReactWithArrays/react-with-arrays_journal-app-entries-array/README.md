# React with Arrays: Journal App with Entries Array

In this challenge we get a data array of journal entries. We want to render each entry in the `EntriesSection` component.

## Tasks

Locate the component that renders your journal entries. Here it's called `EntriesSection`.

Copy the `entries` array below into the component that renders your journal entries.

```jsx


```

- Map over the `entries` array and render each entry in the `EntriesSection` component.
- Remember to use the `key` prop when mapping over the array.
- If you are using this template: How can you render a `<Divider />` component between each entry?
  - Don't break the flexbox layout (a `Fragment` might help)
  - Avoid having a divider below the last or above the first entry

## Development

Run `npm run dev` to start a development server and open the displayed URL in a browser.
